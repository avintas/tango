# OnlyHockey.com - Marketing Positioning & Messaging

## Recommended Positioning

**Primary Tagline:**
"OnlyHockey - The Ultimate Hockey Trivia Game"

**Subtagline/Supporting Text:**
"(with community features)" or "Plus shareable hockey content"

## Strategic Rationale

**Why Trivia is Primary:**

1. **Core Product** - Trivia is what Tango CMS produces; it's the primary content type
2. **Monetizable Service** - Trivia is the service that can be sold and monetized
3. **Clear Value Proposition** - "Ultimate Hockey Trivia Game" is immediately understandable
4. **SEO & Discovery** - People search for "hockey trivia game," not "shareable hockey content"
5. **Differentiation** - Positions OnlyHockey as THE destination for hockey trivia

**Shareables as Supporting Features:**

- Wisdom, greetings, and motivational messages enhance the trivia experience
- They're "also includes" features that add value but don't compete with the core value prop
- They support community engagement and sharing around trivia

## Homepage Messaging

### Hero Section (Above the Fold)

**Main Headline:**
"The Ultimate Hockey Trivia Game"

**Primary CTA:**
"Start Playing" or "Play Trivia Now" - Prominently featured with visual of a trivia question

**Secondary Line (Supporting Features):**
"Plus shareable hockey content: motivational quotes, H.U.G.s, and hockey wisdom"

**Alternative Hero Messaging:**
"Test Your Hockey Knowledge" (with trivia as the clear focus)

## Site Structure: Trivia-First Hierarchy

The site is organized with trivia as the primary pillar, with supporting features:

## Implementation Notes for Tango CMS

When building features or content in Tango CMS that support OnlyHockey:

- Content generation priority: Trivia first, then shareables
- Trivia should be the most prominent, accessible, and well-featured content type
- Shareables should feel like valuable additions, not distractions from the main value prop
