## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### **🔴 Critical: Stats Content Type Mismatch**

- **File:** `lib/gemini-stats.ts`
- **Issue:** Returned `"statistic"` but system expected `"stat"`
- **Impact:** Would cause save failures with "Unsupported content type" error
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## ✨ Features Added

### **✅ Wisdom Generation Endpoint**

- **Created:** `app/api/gemini/generate-wisdom/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Separate endpoint for generic wisdom content
- **Distinction:** Wisdom (generic) vs Penalty Box Philosopher (hockey-specific)
- **Impact:** Completes the 8 content type system
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **Keep UniContent Interface** - Still useful as universal data contract
2. **Delete All uni-gemini-\* Files** - Unused duplicates
3. **Remove Old Unified System** - Hero Collections to be rebuilt
4. **Fix Stats Content Type** - Critical for system to work
5. **Create Wisdom Endpoint** - Complete the 8 content type system
6. **Two Wisdom Types** - Wisdom (generic) + PBP (hockey) both valid

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Incomplete Migrations Leave Debt** - Old unified system was never fully removed
2. **Naming Consistency Matters** - "stat" vs "statistic" caused bugs
3. **Document Architectural Decisions** - Why two wisdom types wasn't clear
4. **Regular Audits Prevent Rot** - Found issues before they became problems
5. **Test End-to-End** - Generation → Save → Database verification
